## Features

 - There is a title, a description, and a display of the current time.
 - When you type in something into the middle div of each row and click the save button in that row, your 'event' gets saved to local storage.
 - When you load the page again, your events saved in local storage appear where you saved them.
 - All the center divs of each row display as gray if the time block is past the current hour, red if the time block is within the current hour, and green if the time block is before the current hour.
 - You may schedule events in the current day from the hours of 9am to 5pm.
